					<p>
						Hi, I'm qdb, a free and open-source short url service. I was created by Midas van Oene, out of pure curiosity. </p>
						
					<p>
						This is my readme file, you should read me. You will get to know a lot about who I am and how I work, maybe even
						more importantly... How you can set me to work! I function on quite possibly every hosting medium available,
						I do require <a>mysql</a> and <a>PHP</a> but those are quite common. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						An important feat about me is my adaptability, in other words.. I can change shape! It all depends on who is using me though,
						in order to make me function on a different platform you'll need to get your coding gloves on. You are allowed to:	
						
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>There is no license; you are free to use, change and distribute the code as you wish.</li>
						<li>This means you can start your own short url website using this code!</li>
						<li>You are free to rebrand and modify and even offer it up on your own website.</li>
						<li>No credits are required!</li>
						<li>This script will always be free.</li>
					</ul>

				<p>Installing qdb is easy, all you need is some webspace and a mysql server. Most shared and or free hosting support this.</p>

				
				<p>Firstly create a database, you will need the following info:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>MySQL host</li>
					<li>MySQL user</li>
					<li>MySQL password</li>
					<li>MySQL database</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>If you have no clue what either of those things are: click here.</p>
				
				<p>So you've got your database set up? Great! Let us open phpMyAdmin and run the .sql file we have. You can do this by either; copying the code; manually creating the tables, or uploading the file and letting phpMyAdmin do the work for you.</p>
				
				<p>Next stop: conf.inc.php</p>
				<p>Change the variables to your desire, save the file and re-upload.</p>
				
				<p>Enjoy your short URL service!</p>

				<h1><a id="#About">About</a></h1>
				<p>QDB was written by Midas van Oene for educational purposes only. This website functions as a result of that, I intend to improve and update this script until I feel it has become useful, then I will deliver it to the community. (Through some sort of github probably..)</p>
				
				<p>I got the idea for making this website/script when I was watching some PHP tutorials, <a href="http://phpacademy.org">the phpacadamy</a> one's are a lot of fun. Props to them! :)
